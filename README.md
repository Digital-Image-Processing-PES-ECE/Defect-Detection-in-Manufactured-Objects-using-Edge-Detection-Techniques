# Project Name

### Project Description:
A simple solution has been provided for detecting defects in manufactured objects. It involves Digital Image Processing techniques such as edge detection to compare an image of the manufactured product with a reference product image. 

#### Course concepts used - 
1. - Edge Detection Algorithms

   
#### Additional concepts used -
1. - Using XOR for finding differences 

   
#### Dataset - 
Difficult to find proper databases and hence used images from the internet for testing.

#### Novelty - 
1. - Highlights defect locations
2. - Classifies defects into 3 types
3. - Provides a confidence score to check accuracy of detection

### Limitations and Future Work: Major limitation is the dependency on quality of images. As it uses edge detection it is sensitive to noise which may give erroneous results. Another drawback is a lack of standardised dataset for testing. Hence we were forced to use random images from the internet for testing.
